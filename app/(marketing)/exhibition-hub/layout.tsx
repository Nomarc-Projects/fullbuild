/**
 * Exhibition Hub availability.
 *
 * Controlled by the super-admin "Exhibition Hub" toggle (a DB-backed setting):
 *   - ON  → open to everyone.
 *   - OFF → non-admins see the Coming Soon screen; admins always get through.
 *
 * Gated in a layout rather than per page so the whole subtree is covered by one
 * check — browse, product detail, compare, cart and the three checkout steps.
 * Gating only the index would leave the commerce routes reachable by direct
 * URL, which is the part that actually takes money.
 *
 * Not in middleware, for the same reason the maintenance gate isn't: the Better
 * Auth session cookie is opaque at the edge, so role is unreadable there and
 * admin bypass is the whole point (see lib/maintenance-gate.ts).
 *
 * Uses the REAL session role, so an admin impersonating a user sees what that
 * user sees rather than bypassing on the impersonator's behalf.
