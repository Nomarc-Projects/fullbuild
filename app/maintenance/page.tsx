 * Scheduled-maintenance screen. No session and no dashboard chrome — it has to
 * render when the things behind it are the reason someone is seeing it. The one
 * read it does make, `getMaintenance()`, is guaranteed non-throwing: it swallows
 * its own errors and falls back to the copy below, so a database outage still
 * produces this page rather than an error boundary.
 *
 * The illustration sits in a tinted, rounded frame rather than bare on the page.
 * The source GIF is drawn on white, so on a dark background it would otherwise
 * read as a glaring white slab; the frame plus a slight dark-mode dim keeps it
 * sitting in the page instead of punching a hole through it.
