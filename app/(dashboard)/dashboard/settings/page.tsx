/**
 * Two presentations of the same settings, chosen by viewport.
 *
 * The stacked list of tappable rows (SettingsHub) is a phone pattern: it was
 * being served to desktop too, where it wasted the width and buried every
 * section one tap deeper than necessary. Desktop gets the designed two-pane
 * layout instead — section rail on the left, the section itself on the right.
 *
 * Both render and CSS picks one, rather than branching on a JS breakpoint:
 * a width-based branch would flash the wrong layout on first paint and
 * disagree between server and client render.
