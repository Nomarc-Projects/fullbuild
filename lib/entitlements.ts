 *   1. Auth/role state: visitor → client (signed-in, no role) → exhibitor /
 *      professional (signed-in WITH a role) → admin. There are only two account
 *      types — professional (general user, who also buys & hires) and exhibitor.
 *   2. Plan (professional-centric): free → plus → pro → premium.
 *
 * Exhibitors are sellers on their own commerce track (products, analytics, ads)
 * — they are NOT gated by the professional plan matrix. Plan gates
 * (plus/pro/premium) apply to professionals.
 *
 * A capability evaluates to one of three states, mirroring the design legend:
 *   - "granted": fully usable.
 *   - "locked":  visible but not usable → show CTA + an upgrade/sign-in prompt.
 *   - "hidden":  not shown at all.
