    tags: ["about", "overview", "what is nomarc", "nomadic architects", "platform"],
    body: `Nomarc Data Gig is a digital marketplace for Nigeria's construction ecosystem, operated by Nomadic Architects. It brings three groups onto one platform: construction professionals looking for work and collaborators, exhibitors selling building materials and products, and buyers or clients sourcing both.

The idea is simple — staffing a build, sourcing materials and finding verified people are all the same problem of trust and discovery, so Nomarc puts them in one place. Professionals build a verified profile and win work; exhibitors list products and sell to a trade audience; buyers hire and purchase without cold-calling strangers.

Nomarc is Nigeria-focused: pricing is in naira, payouts run to Nigerian bank accounts, and the professional categories match how the local industry actually works.`,

    body: `A typical journey on Nomarc:

1. **Create an account** and pick what you are here to do — practise as a professional, or exhibit and sell products.
2. **Build your profile or storefront.** Professionals add qualifications, education and a company page. Exhibitors add a product catalogue with variants and pricing.
3. **Get discovered.** Professionals appear in the directory and can apply to posted jobs. Exhibitor products appear in the shop and can be promoted.
4. **Transact.** Jobs run through applications and hiring; products run through quotes, orders, invoices and fulfilment.
5. **Get paid.** Payments settle to your wallet, with a payout ledger and escrow behind it, and invoices are generated automatically.

Everything above lives inside the dashboard once you are signed in.`,

- **Professionals** upload qualifications and credentials to their profile; verified professionals carry a badge and surface higher in the directory.
- **Companies** can add credentials to a public company page.
- **KYC** is required before payouts are released, which keeps payment details tied to a real, checked identity.
- **Moderation** covers products and listings, and disputes can be raised on an order.

Verification is a review process, not instant — allow a little time after submitting documents.`,

- A **verified professional profile** with qualifications, education and portfolio, plus a public company page if you run a practice.
- **The job board** — browse and apply to real posted opportunities, track applications and save drafts.
- **Post jobs yourself.** If you are leading a project and need a team, you can post a job and hire from the network.
- **The professional directory** to find and be found by collaborators.
- **Messaging, saved lists and a network** to keep working relationships in one place.

- **Orders and fulfilment** — accept orders, respond to quote requests (RFQs), fulfil, and issue invoices with automatic numbering.
- **A customers CRM** derived from your order history, with a detail view and CSV export.
- **Sales analytics** and, on the top tier, homepage product ads.

- **Request quotes (RFQ)** when you need pricing on a larger or non-standard order, and negotiate in-thread.
- **Orders and invoices** — buy now or accept a quote, track fulfilment, and keep invoices on file.
- **Saved items, lists and addresses** so repeat procurement is quick.
