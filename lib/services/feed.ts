 * Construction industry newsfeed — the Phase 1 MVP "everyday industry
 * platform" surface. Aggregates the newest activity across the network into
 * one stream: job postings, newly listed companies, professionals joining,
 * published articles and upcoming events. Admin-curated sources only (no
 * free-form UGC), so nothing new enters the moderation queue.
 *
 * Each source contributes its latest rows; we merge and sort by time here
 * rather than in SQL so every source keeps its own index-friendly LIMIT.
