/* ── The single definition of "how complete is this profile" ─────────────
 *
 * There were two, and both rendered on screen at the same time disagreeing with
 * each other: computeCompleteness() in ./profile.ts scored nine checks and drove
 * the "Profile Complete 56%" tile, while getOnboardingChecklist() in
 * ./onboarding.ts scored six items and drove the "Your profile is 50% complete!"
 * panel directly beneath it. Both were internally correct, which is what made it
 * confusing rather than obviously broken.
 *
 * This module is now the only answer. It lives outside both "use server" files
 * so either can import it (a "use server" module may only export async
 * functions, so shared helpers cannot live in one), and `server-only` keeps it
 * off the client.
