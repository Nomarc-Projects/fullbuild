/* ── Transient DB connection errors: retry + backoff ───────────────────
 * CockroachDB Cloud resolves through a proxy hostname that has occasionally
 * thrown `getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN` (DNS blips) plus the usual TCP dropouts
 * (resets, timeouts, "connection terminated"). A single one of those used to
 * take down whichever server-side call happened to be in flight — most
 * visibly the admin overview, which opens with session + stats reads, but the
 * same flake could hit any query. These helpers retry the *connection*, not
 * the transaction: only transient network/DNS failures are retried, real
 * query failures (constraint violations, bad SQL, permission denials) are
 * rethrown untouched.
