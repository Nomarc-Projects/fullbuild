/**
 * Page tours — one per major dashboard route, referenced by route-match.ts.
 *
 * Each covers what is *actually* on the page and what the user can do there.
 * Shared pages (profile, messages, people, settings…) serve every role via a
 * multi-audience array; role-specific pages narrow their audience so "Tour
 * this page" shows the right content for whoever is looking.
 *
 * Targets are `data-tour` anchors on the real components. Where no anchor
 * exists yet the step falls back to a center step (still informative, never
 * stalls) — anchors get added incrementally.
