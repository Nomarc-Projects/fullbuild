 * Base-user tours.

 * row exists yet (see lib/auth.ts and the multi-role model in lib/db/schema.ts).
 * A role is acquired lazily, by trying to do the thing — apply for work, add a
 * product, post a job — which puts a gate wizard in front of the page and grants
 * the role on completion. These tours exist to make that model legible instead of
 * leaving a new user staring at sections that look broken.
