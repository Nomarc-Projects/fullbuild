 * Personal Profile, Qualifications and Company Profile used to mount the very

 * headers and two breadcrumbs. Beyond being confusing, it meant every change to
 * the profile (notably making it role-aware) had to be made twice and would
 * eventually drift.
 *
 * The split is now by purpose: /dashboard/profile owns public identity, and
 * Settings owns account administration. These rows stay listed, because people
 * do look for their profile under Settings, but they navigate rather than
 * duplicate. Verification goes with the profile too, since it drives the public
 * trust badge that sits on it.
